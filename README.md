# Native Android apps with Python and BeeWare

## Description

In this tutorial you will learn how to build native Android apps using Python and the BeeWare tools which will interact with the Android APIs, just as if they were written in Java.

[See here the instructions to setup your laptop beforehand](https://github.com/Dayof/pycon-voc-tutorial).

## Audience

Anyone interested in building Android apps using Python.
We expect students to be comfortable writing Python code, using the command line and doing some troubleshooting.
Java experience is not required, but it will be helpful.

After attending this tutorial, students shall be able to build their own apps, to troubleshoot common issues and report problems in the stack.

Hopefully theyâ€™ll also feel empowered to help improve the tools as well. :)
