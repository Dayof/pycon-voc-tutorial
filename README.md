# Native Android apps with Python and BeeWare

## Description

In this tutorial you will learn how to use Python and the tools from the BeeWare suite to build simple native Android applications.

We’ll use VOC (a compiler from Python to Java bytecode), Briefcase (a tool for packaging and building a Python app for several platforms) and a cookiecutter template to write Python apps that interact with the Android APIs, just as if they were written in Java.

Please make sure you have Python 3.4+, JDK and the Android SDK installed in your computer.

## Audience

Anyone interested in building small Android apps using Python and calling the Java API. I expect students to be comfortable writing Python code, using the command line and doing some troubleshooting.
Java experience is not required, but it will be helpful.

After attending this tutorial, students shall be able to use the BeeWare tools, the cookiecutter template, the examples and the existing documentation to build their own apps on their own; and to troubleshoot and report problems in the stack.

Hopefully they’ll also feel empowered to help improve the tools as well.
